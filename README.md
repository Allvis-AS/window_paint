# Painting with power

`WindowPaint` lets you pan, zoom and paint over any other widget.

It uses the new `InteractiveViewer` together with a `CustomPainter`, giving you the bare minimum to get you started.

## Getting Started

This library does not ship with UI controls as part of its core library,
but you can copy the `example/lib/window_paint_control.dart` file and use
that as a starting point.

*TODO: Write the rest of the documentation...*
