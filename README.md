# Painting with power

`WindowPaint` lets you pan, zoom and paint over any other widget.

It uses the new `InteractiveViewer` together with a `CustomPainter`, giving you the bare minimum to get you started.

## Getting Started

This library does not ship with UI controls as part of its core library,
but you can copy the `example/lib/window_paint_control.dart` file and use
that as a starting point.

*TODO: Write the rest of the documentation...*

## Naming

The name window paint comes from my childhood memories.

Me and my siblings used to paint the windows in our bedrooms with "art", the kind of stunning art you're able to create with this library 👨‍🎨. After drying, our works overlayed the outside world &mdash; which is exactly what this package does.
